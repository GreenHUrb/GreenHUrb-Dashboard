# Services - Readme

Welcome to the Service Section! This readme will guide you through setting up the system, creating API service implementations, building a service, and integrating it with your frontend application. This approach aims to provide a clear and detailed understanding for newcomers.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of TypeScript.
- Familiarity with REST concepts.
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing code.

## 2. Setting Up The API Service

To help newcomers better understand how the service works, we'll walk through a practical example. We're going to create and set up an authentication service, which is like a virtual bouncer that ensures only authorized users can access a system. This hands-on demonstration will give you a clear picture of how the service can be used when you want to create a service and the advantages it offers.

### Create API Service Interfaces

1. Inside your services directory, navigate to the folder called iinterfaces.
2. Create a new file named `apiService.ts`.
2. Define the `ApiService` interface with methods like `login` and `logout`.

### Create API Service

### Create API Controller

<!-- 1. Inside your project directory, create a file named `apiService.ts`.
2. Define the `ApiService` interface with methods like `login` and `logout`.

   ```typescript
   // apiService.ts

   interface ApiService {
     login(username: string, password: string): Promise<boolean>;
     logout(): Promise<boolean>;
     // Add other methods as needed
   } -->
